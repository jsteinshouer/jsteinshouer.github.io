This is a Space invaders clone written in Javascript. I remixed [this project](https://glitch.com/~space-invaders) on [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/). A remix is a term that Gitch uses for cloning someone else's code to change it. 

I customized it by adding some graphics and style to it. In doing so I had to change some of the code to make the game work with the new graphics. This taught me about some of the concepts for creating a game such as the game loop and collision detection.

### Leprechaun Invasion

I also created a St. Patricks Day themed version of it [here](https://glitch.com/~pitch-cake).
