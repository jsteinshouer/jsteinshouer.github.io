title: About me 
---

I am a husband and father, living in Omaha, NE. I am passionate about software development and am lucky enough to do that for a living. 

When not working I enjoy:

- Spending time with my family
- Camping, fishing, and other outdoor activities
- Playing guitar and listening to music
- Cooking
- I occasionally attempt to do some gluten-free home brewing

This site is a platform for me to document things I am learning, working on, or just find interesting.
