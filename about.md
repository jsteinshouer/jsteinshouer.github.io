## **About Me**

I am a husband and father of two sons, living in Omaha, NE. I also do web development. 

## **Do we really need another web development blog?**

No, but I am a developer and can't help but to reinvent the wheel.:)

It is more or less a platform for me to document things I am learning, working on, or just find interesting.

## **More about this blog**

This site is generated using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The theme is [Daktilo](http://daktilo.github.io/).
